# A number of projects using different types of neural networks

Technologies : MATLAB ; Subject : Artificial Neural Networks

Project 1 : Supervised learning and generalization using feedforward neural networks

Analysed the generalization capability of different network training algorithms.

Project 2 : Recurrent Neural Networks

Used a hopfield network in order to retrieve handwritten digits from distorted digits. 
Used an Elman network in order to simulate the Hammerstein System time series

Project 3 : Unsupervised Learning

Used Principal Component Analysis to predict handwritten digits
Used a Self Organsing map in order to cluster the Iris dataset

Project 4 : Stacked Autoencoders and Convolutional neural networks

Analysis Digit classification accuracy with different configurations of stacked autoencoders with different number of layers and neurons.
Analysed the AlexNet Convolutional neural network.


Project 5 : Character Recognition using Hopfield Network

This project studies the retrieving capabilities of the Hopfield Networks in context of character recognition. It consists of three tasks that aim at retrieving stored characters given distorted characters as input :

1. To build a hopfield network that is capable of retrieving only 5 characters. 
2. To determing critical loading capacity of the network. 
3. Determine network configuration in order to retrieve 25 characters. 

Results and analysis presented in Report.pdf

Project 6 : Non-linear regression and classfication with Multi Layer perceptrons

In this project, the task was to design and tune a feedforward neural network for regression in order to estimate an unknown non-linear function of two variables
