# Character Recognition using Hopfield Network

Technologies : MATLAB ; Subject : Artificial Neural Networks

This project studies the retrieving capabilities of the Hopfield Networks in context of character recognition. It consists of three tasks that aim at retrieving stored characters given distorted characters as input :

1. To build a hopfield network that is capable of retrieving only 5 characters. 
2. To determing critical loading capacity of the network. 
3. Determine network configuration in order to retrieve 25 characters.
